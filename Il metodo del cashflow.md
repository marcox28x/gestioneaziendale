Below is an “explain like I’m five” (ELI5) way to see why the business is worth $1,066.67 instead of just $5 / year times some smaller number.

---

## The Setup (Very Simply)

- The business **spits out** $80 every year.
- You **owe** $75 each year to:
    - The **bank** (interest on a $500 loan at 5% = $25), and
    - Your **friend** (return on $500 at 10% = $50).
- That leaves **$5** in your pocket each year **after** paying them.

So you think:

> “I only **keep** $5 each year! Why is the business valued as if it’s $1,066.67 in total?”

---

## ELI5 Explanation

1. **Imagine the $80 is like the total ‘pie’** the business bakes each year.
2. You slice $75 off that pie to pay the bank and friend—**they are part-owners** (lenders and equity).
3. The remaining **$5** is extra—the business is making **more** than just enough to pay what’s required.

But **to value the entire bakery** (not just your slice!), we look at the **whole $80** pie each year.

### Why the whole $80?

Because the bank and your friend **gave you $1,000** in total ($500 debt + $500 equity). You use **that $1,000** to run the bakery and generate $80 of free cash flow every year. The full $80 is the bakery’s output; it just so happens that most of it ($75) goes back to them as their return.

---

## The Simple Math: A Perpetuity

In finance, if you have a **constant** yearly cash flow (the $80 “pie”) forever, and your **“overall required return”** (the WACC) is 7.5%, then the value of that cash flow stream is:

Value=Yearly Cash FlowRequired Return=800.075=1,066.67.\text{Value} = \frac{\text{Yearly Cash Flow}}{\text{Required Return}} = \frac{80}{0.075} = 1{,}066.67.

That’s the **enterprise value** (the value of the whole bakery).

**But wait,** you say, “I only get $5 in my pocket!” That’s because:

- **$75** out of $80 is the “fair” yearly return on the original $1,000.
- **$5** is over and above that “fair” return.

If a business pays its lenders and owners exactly what they signed up for ($75), you’d say the business is “fairly” worth $1,000 at a 7.5% overall return.  
But **we have an extra $5** each year, so there’s extra value:

$5 of ’excess’7.5%=$66.67 of extra value.\frac{\text{\$5 of 'excess'}}{7.5\%} = \text{\$66.67 of extra value}.

Hence, total value = “original $1,000 worth” + “$66.67 extra” = **$1,066.67**.

---

## Another Kid-Friendly Analogy

- **You** found a magic money machine (the bakery) that spits out **$80** each year.
- **Your friend and the bank** gave you **$1,000** to buy it.
- They say: “We want 7.5% of **any** money you use—so $75 each year.”
- You discover the machine actually spits out **$80**, so you pay them their **$75**, and **$5** is left in your hand.
- Because there’s **more** cash ($80) than the 7.5% requirement ($75), the machine is really worth a bit more than $1,000—exactly $66.67 more.
- So if you sold this machine, you’d sell it at $1,066.67, because whoever buys it knows:
    - “I can use it to pay back the $75 needed to finance the purchase (7.5% of $1,000), **and** keep $5 extra.”

---

## In a Nutshell

1. We **always** value the entire **$80** free cash flow (the total pie).
2. We discount that $80 at 7.5% (the WACC).
3. That leads to a total enterprise value of **$1,066.67**.
4. **Of that** $80 each year:
    - $75 is the “normal” return on $1,000 at 7.5%.
    - $5 is “extra,” which adds another $66.67 of value to the original $1,000.

Hence, the business is worth more than the $1,000 contributed by debt and equity, precisely because it pays them **and** still has $5 left over every year.



Yes, that’s exactly the idea. Another way to say it is:

> “A perpetual $5/year ‘coupon’ (at a 7.5% required return) itself is worth $5 / 0.075 = $66.67.”

In other words, if the business produces $5 of _extra_ cash flow every year (forever), an investor (or a bank, or anyone) _would_ be willing to pay $66.67 today to receive that perpetual $5 stream. That’s why you can think of the $66.67 as the “present value of that extra $5 forever,” at a 7.5% discount rate.

Below is a more “realistic” adaptation of the **magic money machine** example to illustrate how **Economic Value Added (EVA)** is **not always** equal to the simple leftover “$5” you see after paying interest and equity distributions. The key is that **EVA** is based on _operating_ profit after tax (NOPAT) and compares it to the _full_ cost of _all_ capital (WACC × Invested Capital). In a simplified example with no taxes and no non-cash items, NOPAT can coincide with “cash flow,” making EVA appear to match the leftover. But once we introduce even modest real-world adjustments—like taxes or proper accounting for interest—EVA can differ.

## 1) The **Original** Ultra-Simplified Example

### Setup Recap

- **Total Invested Capital** = $1,000
    - $500 **debt** at 5%
    - $500 **equity** at 10%
- **Annual Cash Flow (no taxes, no depreciation)** = $80
- **Interest** = $25 (5% of $500)
- **Equity “required” return** = $50 (10% of $500)
- **Leftover** = $80 − ($25 + $50) = $5
- **WACC** = 7.5% (the average of 5% and 10%, weighted by 50/50).
- **Invested Capital** = $1,000

Because there are _no_ taxes or other complications:

- We treat the **$80** as if it’s **NOPAT** (net operating profit after tax), because we assumed zero tax.
- So, **ROIC** = 80 ÷ 1,000 = 8%.
- EVA = (ROIC−WACC)×Capital(\text{ROIC} - \text{WACC}) \times \text{Capital} = (8%−7.5%)×$1,000=$5.(8\% - 7.5\%) \times \$1{,}000 = \$5.

In **that** toy model, indeed EVA equals the $5 leftover each year. That’s why, in the simplest version, you see “$5 leftover” and “$5 EVA” as the same.

---

## 2) Introducing a More Realistic Twist: **Taxes**

Let’s adjust the scenario to be slightly more “real world” by adding a **30%** tax rate and see how EVA can differ from just “$5 leftover.”

### 2A) New Inputs

1. **Debt** = $500 at 5% interest
2. **Equity** = $500 at 10%
3. **Tax rate (T)** = 30%
4. **EBIT** (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) = $80
    - This might be the “operating profit” _before_ interest, _before_ taxes.

Let’s see what happens step by step.

---

### 2B) Calculate **NOPAT** (Net Operating Profit After Taxes)

- **NOPAT** is typically: NOPAT=EBIT×(1−T).\text{NOPAT} = \text{EBIT} \times (1 - T).

Here:

EBIT=$80,T=30%,NOPAT=80×(1−0.30)=80×0.70=$56.\text{EBIT} = \$80, \quad T = 30\%, \quad \text{NOPAT} = 80 \times (1 - 0.30) = 80 \times 0.70 = \$56.

**Note**: NOPAT does **not** subtract interest expense—that’s considered part of financing, not operations.

---

### 2C) Calculate **WACC** with an After-Tax Cost of Debt

Since interest is tax-deductible, the cost of debt in WACC is usually “after-tax.” Let’s do that:

1. **Pre-tax cost of debt** = 5%
2. **After-tax cost of debt** = 5%×(1−30%)=3.5%5\% \times (1 - 30\%) = 3.5\%.
3. **Cost of equity** = 10%.

Since the capital structure is still 50% debt + 50% equity:

WACC=(50%×3.5%)+(50%×10%)=1.75%+5%=6.75%.\text{WACC} = (50\% \times 3.5\%) + (50\% \times 10\%) = 1.75\% + 5\% = 6.75\%.

---

### 2D) Calculate the **Cost of Capital** (in $) and **EVA**

- **Invested Capital** = $1,000.
- **WACC** = 6.75%.

Therefore, the “required dollar return” on $1,000 is:

$1,000×6.75%=$67.50 per year.\$1{,}000 \times 6.75\% = \$67.50 \text{ per year}.

Now we compare that to our **NOPAT**:

EVA=NOPAT−(WACC×Capital)=56−67.50=−$11.50.\text{EVA} = \text{NOPAT} - (\text{WACC} \times \text{Capital}) = 56 - 67.50 = -\$11.50.

**This means EVA is actually negative $11.50.**

In other words, once we properly account for a 30% tax rate (which reduces the operating profit from $80 to $56) **and** use after-tax WACC, the machine **does not** generate enough profit to cover the $67.50 “fair” return that investors require. It’s **destroying** $11.50 of economic value each year, despite having a leftover “cash flow” that might seem positive at first glance.

---

### 2E) Where Did the “Leftover Cash” Go?

If we look at actual “cash flows to investors”:

1. **EBIT** = $80
2. **Interest expense** = $25 (5% of $500)
3. **EBT** = $80 − $25 = $55
4. **Taxes** = 30% × $55 = $16.50
5. **Net income** = $55 − $16.50 = $38.50

- The **debt holder** gets $25 interest.
- **Equity** holders get $38.50 net income (assuming it’s fully distributed).

So total cash out to all investors = $25 + $38.50 = $63.50.

At first glance, you might say, “Hey, we’re paying out $63.50, but the machine made $80 in EBIT. That’s still $16.50 difference,” right? But that $16.50 was paid in **taxes**—so it’s gone from the investors’ perspective.

From an **EVA** lens, we see the **after-tax** operating profit (NOPAT = $56) fails to cover $67.50 of required return on $1,000. Hence, EVA = -$11.50.

---

## 3) Why Is EVA Different from the Simple “Leftover” in This Scenario?

1. **Taxes** reduce the actual operating profit “available” to cover the cost of capital.
2. **EVA** considers after-tax _operating_ profit compared to the _total_ cost of _all_ capital.
3. Once we properly handle interest as a financing cost (outside of EBIT) and apply taxes on EBIT, the calculation shows we’re short of meeting the cost of capital.

In the original no-tax scenario, we artificially had:

NOPAT=$80,WACC=7.5%,Capital=$1,000,EVA=80−75=$5.\text{NOPAT} = \$80, \quad \text{WACC} = 7.5\%, \quad \text{Capital} = \$1{,}000, \quad \text{EVA} = 80 - 75 = \$5.

But the moment we shift to a realistic approach with taxes, we get:

NOPAT=$56,WACC=6.75%,Capital=$1,000,EVA=56−67.50=−$11.50.\text{NOPAT} = \$56, \quad \text{WACC} = 6.75\%, \quad \text{Capital} = \$1{,}000, \quad \text{EVA} = 56 - 67.50 = -\$11.50.

That’s why EVA is no longer “$5.”

---

## 4) Key Takeaways

1. **EVA is about comparing after-tax operating profit (NOPAT) to the full dollar cost of capital.**
2. In the **ultra-simplified** example (no taxes, no depreciation, no working capital changes), your “$80” FCF and “NOPAT” were the same. That made EVA = leftover $5.
3. In a **realistic** scenario:
    - EBIT and NOPAT differ (taxes matter).
    - The after-tax cost of debt is used in WACC.
    - EVA can be **positive** or **negative** depending on how those numbers shake out.
4. **Hence, EVA won’t necessarily match** the naive leftover “cash in your pocket” if you are not using the _true_ after-tax operating profit and the _true_ cost of capital.

---

### Bottom Line

- If you want to see **why EVA might not be $5** in a more realistic world, you must factor in actual NOPAT (which can be lower than EBIT or FCF due to taxes) and a proper after-tax WACC.
- The “$5 leftover” in the no-tax example is just a simplified depiction of “excess returns” _when NOPAT = FCF = $80_ and WACC = 7.5%.
- In reality, once you do the correct EVA math with taxes and after-tax cost of debt, you might end up with a different (and sometimes negative) result.
